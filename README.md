# figmaToCss

To generate CSS files using the Figma API, you'll need to follow these steps:

Get Access to the Figma API:

First, you need to obtain an API token from Figma. You can do this by logging into your Figma account, going to the account settings, and generating a personal access token.

Retrieve Design Data:

Use the Figma API to retrieve the design data. You'll need the file key, which is part of the URL of your Figma file (e.g., in https://www.figma.com/file/FILE_KEY/FILE_NAME, FILE_KEY is what you need).
Make a GET request to the Figma API endpoint to get the file data. The endpoint looks like this: https://api.figma.com/v1/files/{file_key}.
Parse the Design Data:
The response from the Figma API will be in JSON format. You'll need to parse this JSON to extract the necessary information such as colors, typography, spacing, etc.

Generate CSS:

Once you have the design data, you can write a script to convert this data into CSS. This will involve mapping Figma properties to CSS properties. For example, you might map Figma's fills to CSS background-color or color, and text styles to CSS font-family, font-size, font-weight, etc.
Write CSS to a File:
After generating the CSS rules, you can write them to a .css file using file I/O operations in your chosen programming language.
